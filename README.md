# food_mood

Team Members: Leaveil Armstrong, Daniel Nop, Brad Whitcomb, Mara Greco

Project Description: A food application that allows you to research and order food from home.

Sketch of Final Product: This app will allow for the user to locate a restaurant within a user-specified mile radius. When a hungry user is home, the user will launch the foodmood app in order to search for any food-related term. Afterwards, the app will render the results. The displayed results will be from the Yelp API database, which will display the restaurants, ratings, and user reviews corresponding to the food-related search. Next to each result, there will be a button labeled “get delivery,” which the user can click in order to get a delivery quote from the Postmate’s API. The delivery quote will display the cost and the ETA for the delivery. The user will then be able to place the order if he/she chooses to do so.
