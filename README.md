# food_mood

Team Members: Leaveil Armstrong, Daniel Nop, Brad Whitcomb, Mara Greco

Project Description: A food application that allows one to research and order food from home.

Sketch of Final Product: This app will allow for the user to locate a restaurant within a user-specified mile radius. When a hungry user is home, the user will launch the foodmood app in order to search for any food-related term. Afterwards, the app will render the results. The displayed results will be from the Yelp API database, which will display the restaurants, ratings, and user reviews corresponding to the food-related search. Next to each result, there will be a button labeled “get delivery,” which the user can click in order to get a delivery quote from the Postmate’s API. The delivery quote will display the cost and the ETA for the delivery. The user will then be able to place the order if he/she chooses to do so.  

User Story: As a user, I want to use an application that will allow me to locate restaurants in my city that deliver food items of my choice. 

When I am on the landing page: 

1) I can enter a food-related keyword of my choice or a specific restaurant name. 

2) I can choose my city 

3) I can filter the number of results I would like returned based on number. I would like to be able to view:
	
	1) The highest-rated restaurants according to my search 

	2) Delivery quotes for each restaurant 

	3) Access to a menu for each restaurant 

	4) The location of each restaurant by address

	5) The name of each restaurant 

	6) The telephone number for each restaurant 

4) If I see a restaurant that I like, I would like to
